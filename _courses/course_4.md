DTMF dial tone signal generation and detection
======
* Platform: Matalb
* Technology:Singal and System Analysis
* Tasks:By designing a digital oscillator, the corresponding DTMF signal is generated for the playback of dial tone. The DTMF signal amplitude and frequency map of     the corresponding four-digit number is given and decoded to the corresponding four-digit number based on the analysis of the Fourier transform.

Adjustable duty cycle square wave sawtooth wave generator
======
* Platform: Multisim
* Technology:Analog Electronics and Circuit board soldering
* Functions:Dual-supply self-excited oscillation to generate Â±5V sine wave; Designing signal conversion circuits to complete the conversion of sine wave signals to     square waves and square wave signals to sawtooth waves;Adjustable frequency and duty cycle for both square and sawtooth waveforms.

About me
======
I am a third year undergraduate student from the School of Ocean and Space Information,[China University of Petroleum (East China)](https://upc.edu.cn/). My major is Communication Engineering. At present, my research interests are in Information Security,Signal and communication systems, and Artificial Intelligence.

I firmly believe that scientific work requires communication. Therefore, I created this website to share my ideas and research results. If you are interested in one of my ideas feel free to leave a comment on this site or send me an email.

Due to my limited level of knowledge, the articles on this site inevitably have omissions, welcome to correct!

Education
======
* B.S. in Comunication Engineering, China University of Petroleum, 2020

Project experience
======
* Fall 2020: Microcontroller Development
  * Platform: Arduino UNO
  * Technology:C,3D Printing
  * Tasks:Start by easy project,such as RFID card swipe system, 
    traffic light, temperature and humidity display.
    Finally I finished making the tractor car.        
* Summer 2021: Website Design
  * Platform: IDEA,Tomact,Postman
  * Technology:HTML, CSS, js,machine learning,database
  * Tasks:Design of a high school volunteer application platform
  * Functions:Major inquiry, college inquiry, intelligent volunteer application,
   college entrance examination information browsing, etc.
* Fall 2021: Adjustable duty cycle square wave sawtooth wave generator
  * Platform: Multisim
  * Technology:Analog Electronics and Circuit board soldering
  * Functions:Dual-supply self-excited oscillation to generate Â±5V sine wave;
  Designing signal conversion circuits to complete the conversion of sine wave signals 
  to square waves and square wave signals to sawtooth waves;Adjustable frequency and 
  duty cycle for both square and sawtooth waveforms.
 * Fall 2021: DTMF dial tone signal generation and detection
   * Platform: Matalb
   * Technology:Singal and System Analysis
   * Tasks:By designing a digital oscillator, the corresponding DTMF signal is generated 
   for the playback of dial tone. The DTMF signal amplitude and frequency map of 
   the corresponding four-digit number is given and decoded to the corresponding 
   four-digit number based on the analysis of the Fourier transform.
 * Summer 2022: Intelligent Attendance System

excerpt: 'Dynamic Heterogeneous Redundancy (DHR) has been considered as a proactive defense architecture against unknown vulnerabilities and backdoors. It is a heterogeneous, fault tolerant, and redundant system, which ensures the security by constantly switching heterogeneous executors. However, a limited number of heterogeneous executors can be merely switched and 
combined statically. It is diffificult to cope with persistent threats. In this paper, we add evolutionary sub-strategies of executors to solve this problem, studying defense mechanisms of DHR. The attacker and the legitimate user are treated as the visitors and the defender as the server. The original heterogeneous executors are regarded as dynamic distributed heterogeneous executors, aiming to confuse the attacker. Firstly, a game-theoretic analysis of the DHR security mechanism is performed under dynamic incomplete information, and the dilemma of defense is discussed. Secondly, we construct a DHR game model based on evolutionary, which can acquire new equilibriums between the server and visitors through evolutionary sub-strategies. It formally describes strategies and payoffs of all players in the game. And the results are extended to the general case to analyze the Bayesian equilibrium when each service strategy has a different number of evolved sub-strategies. In addition, the correlation factor is added to the game to investigate the impact of the correlation between different heterogeneous executors on defense results. Finally, Gambit and NS2 simulation experiments for the proposed method are shown. Our model proves the effectiveness of the game process and the initiative of defense mechanisms'
